Miriam Hurtado Bodell
======

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Organizational Behavior area at Stanford Graduate School of Business. My research focuses on the development and application of theoretically driven computational text analysis within the social sciences, as well as inquiries into meaning-making processes. Specifically, I am interested in how the meaning of concepts emerges over time, diffuses across societal spheres through social interaction, and becomes contested.

I hold a PhD in Analytical Sociology from the Institute for Analytical Sociology at Linköping University, Sweden, where I remain a proud member of the [Mining for Meaning](https://liu.se/en/research/computational-text-analysis#:~:text=Our%20project%20%22Mining%20for%20Meaning,emergence%20of%20shared%20social%20understandings.) project.
Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master’s degree in Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University, Sweden, and Bachelor's degrees in Statistics and Political Science, with a major in Economics, from Uppsala University."
