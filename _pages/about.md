Miriam Hurtado Bodell
======


I am a Post Doctoral Fellow at the Organizational Behavior area at Stanford Graduate School of Business. My research focuses on the development and application of theoretically-driven computational text analysis in the realm of social science, as well as social inquiries about meaning-making processes.
Specifically, I am investigating how meaning of concepts emerges historically, and diffuse between different societal spheres and through social interaction.

I hold a PhD in Analytical Sociology from the Institute of Analytical Sociology at Linköping University, Sweden and I am still a proud member of [Mining for Meaning](https://liu.se/en/research/computational-text-analysis#:~:text=Our%20project%20%22Mining%20for%20Meaning,emergence%20of%20shared%20social%20understandings.).
Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Master’s degree in Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University, Sweden, and my Bachelor's degrees in in Statistics and Political Science majoring in Economics at Uppsala University
