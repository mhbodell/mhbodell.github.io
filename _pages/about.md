Miriam Hurtado Bodell
======


I am a Ph.D. candidate in Analytical Sociology affiliated with the Institute for Analytical Sociology at Link√∂ping University, Sweden. I am also a proud member of Mining for Meaning.

My doctoral research focuses on the application of theoretically-driven computational text analysis in the realm of social science. Specifically, I am investigating how this approach can be harnessed to examine and comprehend meaning-making processes. The Swedish immigration discourse serves as a compelling case study for my research, offering valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of societal dialogue and perception.
